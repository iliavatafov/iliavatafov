ðŸŒ± I'm currently developing my next React application, Bulgarian Flavours, which is a news website. You can see the current state in the links above.

âš¡ Fun fact: I have 9 years of experience in the banking sector, including roles as a Relationship Manager, Customer Experience Expert, and experienced Salesforce trainer. I also gained valuable experience in Scrum, Jira/Confluence, and UAT testing while working on the project in the bank to implement a new Omnichannel platform.
